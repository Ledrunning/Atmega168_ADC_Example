# Multichannel ADC source based on Atmega 168
## Demo project to show how the analog-to-digital converter works on the Atmega microcontroller

* In this project Atmel AVR microcontroller Atmega 168 and 16 x 2 LCD based on HD44780 is used;

* The project implies an external 8 MHz crystal resonator and precision 5V Voltage Reference;

* The program is written in C language in Atmel Studio 7 IDE;

* The program was simulated and debugged in Proteus VSM;

* FUSEBITS was set only in an external 8MHz crystal oscillator
